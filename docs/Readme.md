# Plan of which games to implement

## Connecting games

Single/double arm
Various strategies of removing dominoes

## Trick taking games

Already have ShiWuHu, after adjusting a bit, TianJiu can be created. 
Still need to think of which tiles to put down - this moment is not present in ShiWuHu

## PaiGow and friends

This can be done as the last game, since it is not so difficult and it's actually popular

## Fishing games

## Combination games

## Single player games

XiangShiFu is already created - but is computer driven.
Probably need to split into actual engine and computer solver.
